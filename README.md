Mathilda's cupcakes
To run this: check out the project, package with maven, and run the jar file
Alternatively: just grab cupcakes-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar and run that with java

Good to know: I didn't get the data to update whenever you upload a new file, so to actually get it to work, first press "Upload sales", upload any of your testing files, and then click any of the graphs you want to see.
At this moment, only graphs can be shown. They might say "$$$ per week" but really, this is just the numbers that were read in the file. So this app will only work correctly with the Total test file; 5 basic cupcakes sold will be interpreted as 5 dollars worth of basic cupcakes.
